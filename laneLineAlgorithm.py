"""Hi everyone! Use examples, references, and any resources you need to code a 
function that covers the topic you chose on the 10/19 Meeting Minutes. Use lots of 
comments to explain your code. If you need any help, make note of it and we can brainstorm next meeting. 
Don't merge your branches until after our code review.
Good luck everyone!"""
